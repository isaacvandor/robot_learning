## Describe your learning orientation (top-down versus bottom-up) and why you have chosen it.  In particular if you choose bottom-up, make sure you specify what this will mean (e.g., which algorithms will you implement, will you eventually switch to a standard toolkit, etc.).
## What is your data collection plan?  How do you plan to get the data needed for your project?  How much data do you think you'll need?  Are there existing datasets you can leverage?
## What sorts of learning algorithms will you apply?  You could choose these based on what you think will work the best or what you want to learn about the most.
## What non-learning baseline algorithm will you compare to?
