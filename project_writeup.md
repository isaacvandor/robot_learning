## Robot Learning Project // Comprobo 18 // Nina Tchirkova and Isaac Vandor   
   
### What was the goal of your project?
### How did you solve the problem?  You should touch on the data you used, the algorithms you applied, etc.  If you implemented your own version of an algorithm as a step in your learning process, make sure to explain what you did for that part of the project as well.
### Describe a design decision you had to make when working on your project and what you ultimately did (and why)? These design decisions could be particular choices for how you implemented some part of an algorithm or perhaps a decision regarding which of two external packages to use in your project.
### What if any challenges did you face along the way?
### What would you do to improve your project if you had more time?
### Did you learn any interesting lessons for future robotic programming projects? These could relate to working on robotics projects in teams, working on more open-ended (and longer term) problems, or any other relevant topic.
